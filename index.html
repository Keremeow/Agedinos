          Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that dominated the land for over 140
          million years (more than 160 million years in some parts of the
          world). They evolved diverse shapes and sizes, from the fearsome giant
          <b>Spinosaurus</b> to the chicken-sized <b>Microraptor</b>, and were
          able to survive in a variety of ecosystems.

          Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles that were the dominant
          terrestrial vertebrates for over 160 million years, from the late
          <b>Triassic period</b><br />
          (about 230 million years ago) until the end of the <b>Cretaceous</b
          ><br />
          (about 66 million years ago). The extinction of most dinosaur species
          occurred during the <b>Cretaceous–Tertiary</b> extinction event. The
          fossil record indicates that birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs
          during the Jurassic period. Some of them survived the
          <b>Cretaceous–Tertiary</b> extinction event, including the ancestors
          of all modern birds. Consequently, in modern classification systems,
          <b>birds</b> are considered a type of dinosaur as they are related to
          raptors etc. The only group of which that survives until the present
          day, dinosaurs became extinct as a giant <b>asteroid (meteor)</b>
          fell on earth 66-65 million years ago

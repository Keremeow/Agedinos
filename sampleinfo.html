      <p class="p2">
        Tyrannosaurus rex was one of the most ferocious predators to ever walk
        the Earth. With a massive body, sharp teeth, and jaws so powerful they
        could crush a car, this famous carnivore dominated the forested river
        valleys in western North America during the late Cretaceous period, 68
        million years ago. Although T. rex is a household name, what we know
        about this tyrannosaur is constantly evolving. Improved technologies,
        such as biomechanical modeling and x-ray imaging, have allowed
        scientists to gain a deeper understanding of how this apex predator
        lived.
